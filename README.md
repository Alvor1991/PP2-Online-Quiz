## User Experience (UX)

### Project Goals

* Celebrate 1970s music - immerse users in the vibrant and iconic music of the 1970s, showcasing its cultural significance and diversity.

* Offer an engaging quiz experience - create a fun and interactive quiz format that challenges users' knowledge while providing entertainment and nostalgia.

* Ensure seamless navigation - design a user-friendly interface that allows effortless movement between quiz questions.

### User Stories

* As a user, I want to seamlessly navigate the music quiz and test my knowledge of 1970s music.

* As a user, I want engaging & challenging quiz questions that provide an enjoyable experience & stimulate my curiosity about 1970s music.

* As a user, I want clear instructions on how to play the quiz and understand the rules, ensuring a smooth and frustration-free experience.

### Color Scheme
![Color scheme image](assets/readme-files/colour-scheme.png)

The color scheme for the quiz interface features a green background wallpaper, creating a visually appealing backdrop for the quiz content. The quiz itself is presented within a white modal, providing a clean and focused environment for users to engage with the questions. To ensure readability and clarity, black text is employed within the modal, offering a stark contrast against the white background.

In the feedback system, red colors (#e56d6d) are utilized to indicate incorrect scores, drawing attention to areas where users may need improvement or further review. Conversely, green colors (#83d5a3) are employed to signify correct scores, offering positive reinforcement and highlighting successful responses.

Overall, this color scheme prioritizes clarity, readability, and user engagement, enhancing the overall experience.

### Wireframes

[Balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com/) was used to create a layout of the website in the planning phase. Here are my initial layout designs. As you will see in the features section, I have since added a progress bar and a score counter and home icon buttons. It is a simple design that will also look similar on mobile.
